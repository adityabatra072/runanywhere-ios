//
//  Audio ingress for the voice agent. The C ABI owns no microphone access;
//  the platform SDK captures raw mic frames and pushes them continuously into
//  the C core via rac_voice_agent_feed_audio_proto. The core performs energy-
//  based utterance segmentation and runs the STT -> LLM -> TTS turn pipeline
//  itself, returning the synthesized reply inline for playback. This driver is
//  therefore a thin capture -> feed -> play loop with NO SDK-side VAD.
//
//  Playout runs CONCURRENTLY with the feed loop. It used to be awaited inline,
//  which stopped the feed for the whole of a reply and then dropped everything
//  captured during it — so speaking over the agent could not be heard at all and
//  the only way to take the turn back was the on-screen control. The core
//  already decides whether an onset inside the audible window is a real
//  interruption or the agent hearing itself (see the echo estimate in
//  voice_agent_feed_abi.cpp); this layer's job is only to keep the frames
//  flowing and to stop the speaker when the core says the user has the turn.
