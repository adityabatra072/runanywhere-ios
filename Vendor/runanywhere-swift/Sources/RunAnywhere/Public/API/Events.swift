///
/// A model is hundreds of megabytes to several gigabytes, so a bare percentage
/// cannot distinguish a slow transfer from a stalled one. C++ already measures
/// throughput and projects a finish time (`download_orchestrator.cpp` sets
/// `bytes_per_second` and `eta_seconds`), and the `DownloadProgress` proto has
/// carried both — along with the retry count and the position in a multi-file
/// plan — the whole time. Those fields were computed, sent across the ABI, and
/// then dropped at this boundary, so no consumer could show a rate or a
/// remaining time no matter what it did.
///

/// each computing a rate from two successive UI-thread samples would disagree
/// with each other and with the transfer that knows its own history.
///
/// Optional fields are `nil` when genuinely unknown rather than `0`, so a
